3.4 question 1)
### Your answer here ###
No, it can have more states than the original, or less. It can also have
a different amount of transitions.
Take, for example, a TM which has a six bit string as input and turns every
1 into a 0. This can have 3 state and 4 transitions:

Q = ['t', 'r', 'Q1']
Sigma = ['0', '1']
Gamma = ['0', '1', '⊔', '⊢']
delta = [(('Q1', '⊢'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q1', '0'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q1', '1'), ('Q1', '0', '>'))
         (('Q1', '⊔'), ('t', '0', '>'))
        ]
s = 'Q1'
t = 't'
r = 'r'

But it can also have 4 states and 7 transitions:

Q = ['t', 'r', 'Q1','Q2']
Sigma = ['0', '1']
Gamma = ['0', '1', '⊔', '⊢']
delta = [(('Q1', '⊢'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q1', '0'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q1', '1'), ('Q2', '0', '>')),
         (('Q2', '0'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q2', '1'), ('Q1', '0', '>')),
         (('Q1', '⊔'), ('t', '0', '>')),
         (('Q2',' ⊔'), ('t', '0', '>'))
        ]
s = 'Q1'
t = 't'
r = 'r'

These two will give the same execution trace for every six bit string input,
but I wouldn't call them identical.

3.4 question 2)
### Your answer here ###
I don't think so. If you make a TM from the first trace, you can also use it
to get the second trace, since only the last step is different and this
transition also exists in the first trace.
So this trace gives no new information, so you don't need all 64 traces
to create the TM.
